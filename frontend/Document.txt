Chapter 1 - Build flow

* Login and Signup page
* frontend of Home page
* Profile and Edit Profile page



Chapter 2 -Smoothly built parts of this project

* Login and Signup pages have become a cake, including frontend and the backend.
* Home page desigining was also not that tough




Chapter 3 - The Tricky ones
* Profile page was tricky and had to think on how would I add the post and how can I save memory on storing pictures
*


Chapter 4 - The difficulties faced during the project and how I handled them

* I used find instead of findOne and hence faced rendering issues in the frontend - I wasted almost half an hour finding the mistake. Ended up finding that find returns an array where as findOne returns an object.

* Axios being asynchronous caused rendering issues - fixed it using a loading component called spinner till it gets the data from the backend

* When you reload any page, the login details disappear -


* Issues with the profile as the username was showing null at times -
